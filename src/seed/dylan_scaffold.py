Dynamic Team Agent: A multi-agent scaffold inspired by DyLAN (Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network)

This scaffold implements a two-stage paradigm:
1. Team Optimization: Selecting the most effective agents based on an Agent Importance Score
2. Task Solving: Using the optimized team to solve the CTF challenge

The scaffold maintains a dynamic communication structure between agents, allowing them to
collaborate efficiently and effectively while having distinct roles and expertise.
